<b>Unity GameobjectSelector Tool</b>

Make sure to place this script in the Editor folder. To open the window click 'MyTools/GameobjectSelector'.
This window lets you assign a gameobject to the ObjectToSelect field. Once a gameobject is assigned, if the gameobject
has any child gameobjects, four buttons will show up, giving you the following options. 
<br>
1.Select Parent gameobject<br>
2.Select First child gameobject<br>
3.Select Last child gameobject<br>
4.Select all child gameobjects<br>
This is useful in situations where there are many child gameobjects and you don't wanna have to scroll through the hierarchy
every time you wanna select the first, last or all child gameobject.
<br>
Hope this helps.
